# Local development overrides
#
# Uncomment these patches to use local checkouts instead of git dependencies.
# This is useful when developing ubt or reth alongside this ExEx.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Clone the repos to sibling directories (../ubt, ../reth-ubt)
#   2. Uncomment the relevant [patch] section below
#   3. Run `cargo build` - Cargo will use local paths instead of git
